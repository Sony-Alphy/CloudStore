Product Catalog: Browse, search, and filter products.

Shopping Cart & Order Processing: Add items to a cart, update quantities, and complete orders.

Admin Dashboard: CRUD operations for products, order management, and user management.

Cloud Integration & Containerization: Use Docker for containerizing the app and integrate with cloud services (e.g., AWS ECS or Kubernetes) for deployment.
